For the creation of the AI model we used Python algorithms and TensorFlow. We are hoping to create an app that eliminate useless seismic data gathered on the Moon and Mars, sending only data related to the occurance of quakes on the Moon and Mars to Earth.
We started with data analysis. During data analysis we detected that some data is noisy. Using aboslute RMA we filtered the data. This helped us highlighting patterns of quakes that happened on the Moon and Mars, minimizing noise. Afterwards we created a data loader. This component helped us preparing data for model training. Then we created a single layer recurrent neural net architecture model that is suitable for time series data. Finally, we performed model training and inference to get the data.

To visualize seismic events that occur on the Moon and Mars, we developed an app using C++, OpenGL and ImGui. We are hoping to create a user-friendly app that makes it easy for everybody (including people from other fields and nonprofessionals) to visualize quakes occurring on the Moon and Mars.
